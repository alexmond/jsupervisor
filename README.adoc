A Spring Boot implementation of a process supervisor system that allows monitoring and managing multiple processes in a
Java environment.

== Overview

This project provides a robust process supervision solution built with Spring Boot 3.x. It offers functionality to:

- Monitor process status and health
- Manage process lifecycle (start, stop, restart)
- Collect system metrics (CPU, memory usage)
- Provide REST API for process management
- Support multiple health check types including HTTP, TCP port, Spring Boot Actuator, and command-line execution checks

== Features

- Process Management
* Start/Stop/Restart processes
* Graceful shutdown support with configurable timeout
* Working directory and environment variables configuration
* Command-line arguments support

- Health Monitoring
* HTTP endpoint health checks
* TCP port availability checks
* Spring Boot Actuator integration
* Custom command-line health checks
* Configurable check intervals

- Logging
* Separate stdout and stderr log files
* Configurable log rotation
* Application-specific log paths
* Append or overwrite log modes
