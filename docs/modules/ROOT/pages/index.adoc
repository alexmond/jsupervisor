== Overview

JSupervisor is a process management and supervision system that helps monitor and control applications running on a system.

== Process Status

A process in JSupervisor can be in one of the following states:

* `not_started` - Process has not been started yet
* `running` - Process is currently running
* `finished` - Process completed successfully
* `unknown` - Process state cannot be determined
* `failed` - Process terminated with an error
* `failed_to_start` - Process could not be started
* `stopped` - Process was gracefully stopped
* `stopping` - Process is in the process of stopping
* `aborted` - Process was forcefully terminated
* `starting` - Process is in the process of starting
* `healthy` - Process is running and health checks pass
* `unhealthy` - Process is running but health checks fail

== Process Information

Each monitored process provides the following information:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Field |Description

|name
|Name of the process

|status
|Current process status (see Process Status section)

|pid
|Process ID assigned by OS

|startTime
|Timestamp when process was started

|endTime
|Timestamp when process ended (if applicable)

|exitCode
|Process exit code (if process has ended)

|processRuntime
|Duration the process has been running

|processUptime
|Formatted uptime string (e.g. "2d 5h 30m")

|stdoutLogfile
|File path for process stdout logs

|stderrLogfile
|File path for process stderr logs
|===

== Process Events

JSupervisor tracks process lifecycle events including:

* Process start/stop
* Status changes
* Health check results
* Exit codes

Each event contains:

* Event timestamp
* Process name and PID
* Old and new status
* Start/end times
* Exit code (if applicable)
* Process uptime

== Health Checks

JSupervisor supports configurable health checks to monitor process health.
Health check results affect the process status (healthy/unhealthy).
